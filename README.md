## Hej! 🙋‍♀️

Hi, I'm Sara. Business Scientist 👩‍🔬 who combines analytics with engineering unlocking insights from data.

I specialize in developing internal ML tools that streamline workflows, and automate repetitive tasks that enable teams to make more informed decisions 📈. 

I enjoy "torturing" 🔬 data until it says something interesting — Yes, this is possible; there is more than boring and predictable numbers … they reveal opportunities.

With programming, statistical modeling, and machine learning skills 🎸, I translate difficult-to-solve problems into easy-to-solve solutions.
